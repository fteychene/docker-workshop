# Docker workshop

This repository is an introduction to the [docker](https://www.docker.com/) tool.  
The objective is to work with the [docker-engine](https://docs.docker.com/engine/) to run some images, build an app and launch a dev stack with multiple services using [docker-compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/).  

_All the tools and projects used in this presentation are available on github (mine or from other people)._

## Requirements
Docker 1.13+ and docker-compose 1.10+ must be installed on your system for this workshop.  
The installation manual are available at :
 * [docker-engine](https://docs.docker.com/engine/installation/)
 * [docker-compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/)

## Goals
At the end of this workshop you should be able to :
 * run docker images
 * build your own images
 * push images to a registry
 * launch a dev stack implying multiples services
